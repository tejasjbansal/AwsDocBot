## Overview of Amazon Web Services

Publication date: August 27, 2024 (

Amazon Web Services offers a broad set of global cloud-based products including compute, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, loT, security, and enterprise applications: on-demand, available in seconds, with pay-as-you-go pricing. From data warenousing to deployment tools, directories to content delivery, over 200 AWS services are available.

New services can be provisioned quickly, without the upfront fixed expense. This allows enterprises, Start-ups, small and medium-sized businesses, and customers in the public sector to access the Duilding blocks they need to respond quickly to changing business requirements. This whitepaper provides you with an overview of the benefits of the AWS Cloud and introduces you to the services that make up the platform.

## Introduction

In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering IT infrastructure services to businesses as web servicesânow commonly known as cloud computing. One of the key benefits of cloud computing is the opportunity to replace upfront capital infrastructure expenses with low variable costs that scale with your business. With the cloud, businesses no longer need to plan for and procure servers and other IT infrastructure weeks or months in advance. Instead, they can instantly spin up hundreds or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver results faster.

Today, AWS provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world.

This video explores how millions of customers use AWS to take advantage of the efficiencies of cloud computing: What is AWS? | Amazon Web Services introduction

## What Is cloud computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Whether you are running applications that share photos to millions of mobile users or you're supporting the critical operations of your business, a cloud services platform provides rapid access to flexible and low-cost IT resources. With cloud computing, you don't need to make large upfront investments in hardware and spend a lot of time on the heavy lifting of managing that hardware. Instead, you can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need to power your newest bright idea or operate your IT department. You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly, and only pay for what you use.

Cloud computing provides a simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a broad set of application services over the internet. A cloud services platform such as Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.

## Six advantages of cloud computing

- Â¢ Trade fixed expense for variable expense â Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you're going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume.
- Â¢ Benefit from massive economies of scale â By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay aS-you-go prices.
- e Stop guessing capacity â Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a Capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes' notice.
- - Increase speed and agility â In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers trom weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.
- e Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers â Focus on projects that ditferentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the neavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.
- - Go global in minutes â Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.

## Types of cloud computing

Cloud computing provides developers and IT departments with the ability to focus on what matters most and avoid undifferentiated work such as procurement, maintenance, and capacity planning. As cloud computing has grown in popularity, several different models and deployment strategies have emerged to help meet specific needs of different users. Each type provides you with different levels of control, flexibility, and management.

## Deployment models

A cloud-based application is fully deployed in the cloud and all parts of the application run in the cloud. Applications in the cloud have either been created in the cloud or have been migrated from an existing infrastructure to take advantage of the benefits of cloud computing. Cloudbased applications can be built on low-level infrastructure pieces or can use higher level services that provide abstraction from the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of core infrastructure.

## Private cloud (on-premises)

The deployment of resources on-premises, using virtualization and resource management tools, is sometimes called the private cloud. On-premises deployment doesn't provide many of the benefits of cloud computing but it is sometimes sought for its ability to provide dedicated resources. In most cases, this deployment model is the same as legacy IT infrastructure while using application management and virtualization tecnnologies to try and increase resource utilization.

## Hybrid

A hybrid deployment is a way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud. The most common method of hybrid deployment is between the cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure to extend, and grow, an organization's infrastructure into the cloud while connecting cloud resources to the internal system. For more information on how AWS can help you with your hybrid deployment, visit our AWS Solutions for Hybrid and Multicloud page.

Deployment models

## Global infrastructure

The AWS Cloud infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones. An AWS Region is a physical location in the world where we have multiple Availability Zones. Availability Zones consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. These Availability Zones offer you the ability to operate production applications and databases that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than would be possible from a single data center. For the latest information on the AWS Cloud Availability Zones and AWS Regions, refer to AWS Global Infrastructure.

## Security and compliance

## Security

Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority. As organizations embrace the scalability and flexibility of the cloud, AWS is helping them evolve security, identity, and compliance into key business enablers. AWS builds security into the core of our cloud infrastructure, and offers foundational services to help organizations meet their unique security requirements in the cloud.

As an AWS customer, you will benefit from a data center and network architecture built to meet the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations. Security in the cloud is much like security in your on-premises data centersâonly without the costs of maintaining facilities and nardware. In the cloud, you don't nave to manage physical servers or storage devices. Instead, you use software-based security tools to monitor and protect the tlow of information into and out of your cloud resources.

An advantage of the AWS Cloud is that it allows you to scale and innovate, while maintaining a secure environment and paying only for the services you use. This means that you can have the security you need at a lower cost than in an on-premises environment.

As an AWS customer you inherit all the best practices of AWS policies, architecture, and operational processes built to satisfy the requirements of our most security-sensitive customers. Get the flexibility and agility you need in security controls.

The AWS Cloud enables a shared responsibility model. While AWS manages security of the cloud, you are responsible for security in the cloud. This means that you retain control of the security you choose to implement to protect your own content, platform, applications, systems, and networks no differently than you would in an on-site data center.

AWS provides you with guidance and expertise througn online resources, personnel, and partners. AWS provides you with advisories for current issues, plus you have the opportunity to work with AWS when you encounter security issues.

You get access to hundreds of tools and features to help you to meet your security objectives. AWS provides security-specific tools and features across network security, configuration management, access control, and data encryption.

Security

Finally, AWS environments are continuously audited, with certifications from accreditation bodies across geographies and verticals. In the AWS environment, you can take advantage of automated tools for asset inventory and privileged access reporting.

## Benefits of AWS security

- Â¢ Keep Your data safe â The AWS infrastructure puts strong safeguards in place to help protect your privacy. All data is stored in highly secure AWS data centers.
- e Meet compliance requirements â AWS manages dozens of compliance programs in its infrastructure. This means that segments of your compliance have already been completed.
- e Save money â Cut costs by using AWS data centers. Maintain the highest standard of security without having to manage your own facility
- e Scale quickly â Security scales with your AWS Cloud usage. No matter the size of your business, the AWS infrastructure is designed to keep your data Safe.

## Compliance

AWS Cloud Compliance helps you understand the robust controls in place at AWS for security and data protection in the cloud. Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer, and you can visit the Shared Responsibility Model to learn more. Customers can feel confident in operating and building on top of the security controls AWS uses on its infrastructure.

The IT infrastructure that AWS provides to its customers is designed and managed in alignment with best security practices and a variety of IT security standards. The following is a partial list of assurance programs with which AWS complies:

- SOC 1/ISAE 5402, SOC 2, SOC 3
- FISMA, DIACAP, and FeqdRAMP
- ISO 90071, ISO 2/001, ISO 2/017, ISO 2/018

AWS provides customers a wide range of information on Its IT control environment in whitepapers, reports, certifications, accreditations, and other third-party attestations. More information is available in the Risk and Compliance whitepaper and the AWS Security Center.

## AWS Fargate

AWS Fargate is a compute engine for Amazon ECS that allows you to run containers without naving to manage servers or clusters. With AWS Fargate, you no longer Nave to provision, configure, and Scale clusters of VMs to run containers. This removes the need to choose server types, decide wnen to scale your clusters, or optimize cluster packing. Fargate removes the need for you to interact with or think about servers or clusters. Fargate lets you focus on designing and building your applications instead of managing the infrastructure that runs them.

Amazon ECS has two modes: Fargate launch type and EC2 launch type. With Fargate launch type, all you have to do is package your application in containers, specify the CPU and memory requirements, define networking and IAM policies, and launch the application. EC2 launch type allows you to Nave server-level, more granular control over the infrastructure that runs your container applications. With EC2 launch type, you can use Amazon ECS to manage a cluster of servers and schedule placement of containers on the servers. Amazon ECS keeps track of all the CPU, memory and other resources in your cluster, and also finds the best server for a container to run on based on your specified resource requirements.

You are responsible for provisioning, patching, and scaling clusters of servers. You can decide which type of server to use, which applications and how many containers to run in a cluster to optimize utilization, and when you should add or remove servers from a cluster. EC2 launch type gives you more control of your server clusters and provides a broader range of customization options, which might be required to support some specific applications or possible compliance and government requirements.

## AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consumeâtnhere is no charge when your code Is not running.

Amazon QLDB Is a fully managed ledger database that provides a transparent, immutable, and cryptograpnically verifiable transaction log owned by a central trusted authority. Amazon QLDB tracks each and every application data change and maintains a complete and verifiable history of changes over time.

Ledgers are typically used to record a history of economic and financial activity in an organization. Many organizations build applications with ledger-like functionality because they want to maintain an accurate history of their applications' data, for example, tracking the history of credits and debits in banking transactions, verifying the data lineage of an insurance claim, or tracing movement of an item in a supply chain network. Ledger applications are often implemented using custom audit tables or audit trails created in relational databases. However, building audit functionality with relational databases is time-consuming and prone to human error. It requires custom development, and since relational databases are not inherently immutable, any unintended changes to the data are hard to track and verity. Alternatively, blockchain frameworks, such as Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum, can also be used as a ledger. However, this adds complexity as you need to set-up an entire blockchain network with multiple nodes, manage its infrastructure, and require the nodes to validate each transaction before it can be added to the ledger.

Amazon QLDB Is a new class of database that eliminates the need to engage in the complex development effort of building your own ledger-like applications. With QLDB, your data's change nistory is immutable â it cannot be altered or deleted â and using cryptography, you can easily verify that there have been no unintended modifications to your application's data. QLDB uses an immutable transactional log, Known as a journal, that tracks eacn application data change and maintains a complete and verifiable history of changes over time. QLDB is easy to use because it provides developers with a familiar SQL-like API, a flexible document data model, and full support for transactions.

## AWS IoT Analytics

AWS loT Analytics is a fully managed service that makes it easy to run and operationalize sophisticated analytics on massive volumes of loT data without having to worry about the cost and complexity typically required to build an loT analytics platform. It is the easiest way to run analytics on loT data and get insights to make better and more accurate decisions for loT applications and machine learning use cases.

loT data is highly unstructured which makes it difficult to analyze with traditional analytics and business intelligence tools that are designed to process structured data. lol data comes from devices that often record fairly noisy processes (such as temperature, motion, or sound). The data from these devices can frequently have significant gaps, corrupted messages, and false readings that must be cleaned up before analysis can occur. Also, loT data is often only meaningful in the context of additional, third party data inputs. For example, to help farmers determine when to water their crops, vineyard irrigation systems often enrich moisture sensor data with rainfall data from the vineyard, allowing for more efficient water usage while maximizing harvest yield.

AWS loT Analytics automates each of the dificult steps that are required to analyze data from lol devices. AWS loT Analytics filters, transforms, and enriches loT data before storing it in a time series data store for analysis. You can setup the service to collect only the data you need trom your devices, apply mathematical transforms to process the data, and enrich the data with devicespecific metadata such as device type and location before storing the processed data. Then, you can analyze your data by running ad hoc or scheduled queries using the built-in SQL query engine, or perform more complex analytics and machine learning inference. AWS loT Analytics makes it easy to get started with machine learning by including pre-built models for common IoT use cases.

You can also use your own custom analysis, packaged in a container, to run AWS loT Analytics. AWS lol Analytics automates the running of your custom analyses created in Jupyter Notebook or your own tools (such as Matlab, Octave, and so on) to be run on your schedule.

AWS loT Analytics is a Tully managed service that operationalizes analyses and scales automatically to support up to petabytes of loT data. With AWS loT Analytics, you can analyze data from millions of devices and build fast, responsive loT applications without managing nardware or infrastructure.

## Amazon Forecast

Amazon Forecast is a fully managed service that uses ML to deliver highly accurate forecasts.

Companies today use everything from simple spreadsheets to complex financial planning software to attempt to accurately forecast future business outcomes such as product demand, resource needs, or financial performance. These tools build forecasts by looking at a historical series of data, which is called time series data. For example, such tools may try to predict the future sales of a raincoat by looking only at its previous sales data with the underlying assumption that the future is determined by the past. This approach can struggle to produce accurate forecasts for large sets of data that have irregular trends. Also, it fails to easily combine data series that change over time (such as price, discounts, web traffic, and number of employees) with relevant independent variables such as product features and store locations.

Based on the same technology used at Amazon.com, Amazon Forecast uses ML to combine time series data with additional variables to build forecasts. Amazon Forecast requires no ML experience to get started. You only need to provide historical data, plus any additional data that you believe may impact your forecasts. For example, the demand for a particular color of a shirt may change with the seasons and store location. This complex relationship is hard to determine on its own, but ML is ideally suited to recognize it. Once you provide your data, Amazon Forecast will automatically examine it, identify what is meaningful, and produce a forecasting model capable of making predictions that are up to 50% more accurate than looking at time Series data alone.

Amazon Forecast

Amazon Forecast is a fully managed service, so there are no servers to provision, and no ML models to build, train, or deploy. You pay only for what you use, and there are no minimum fees and no upfront commitments.

Amazon CDN offers a simple, pay-as-you-go pricing model with no upfront fees or required long-term contracts, and support for the CDN is included in your existing Support subscription.

## Amazon Route 55

Amazon Route 53 ts a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It is designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost-effective way to route users to internet applications by translating Numan-readable names, sucn as www.example.com, into the numeric IP addresses, such as 192.0.2.1, that computers use to connect to each other. Amazon Route 53 is fully compliant with IPv6 as well.

Amazon Route 53 effectively connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWSâsuch as EC2 instances, elastic load balancers, or Amazon $3 bDucketsâand can also be used to route users to infrastructure outside of AWS. You can use Amazon Route 53 to configure DNS health checks to route traffic to healthy endpoints or to independently monitor the health of your application and its endpoints.

Amazon Route 53 traffic flow makes it easy for you to manage traffic globally through a variety of routing types, including latency-based routing, Geo DNS, and weighted round robinâall of which can be combined with DNS Failover in order to enable a variety of low-latency, fault-tolerant architectures.

Amazon Route 53 also offers Domain Name Registrationâ you can purchase and manage domain names such as example.com and Amazon Route 53 will automatically configure DNS settings for your domains.

## AWS Verified Access

AWS Verified Access provides corporate users secure access to your applications without using a virtual private network (VPN). Based on AWS Zero Trust principles, Verified Access evaluates each application request in real time to help ensure that users can only access your applications after they meet specified security requirements. You can group applications, or define unique access policies for each application, with conditions based on user identity and device posture data.

## Amazon VPC

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You nave complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 in your VPC for secure and easy access to resources and applications.

You can easily customize the network configuration for your VPC. For example, you can create a public-facing subnet for your web servers that has access to the Internet, and place your backend systems, such as databases or application servers, in a private-facing subnet with no Internet access. You can leverage multiple layers of security (including security groups and network access control lists) to help control access to EC2 instances in each subnet.

Additionally, you can create a hardware virtual private network (VPN) connection between your corporate data center and your VPC and leverage the AWS Cloud as an extension of your corporate data center.

## Amazon VPC Lattice

Amazon VPC Lattice provides fully managed support for service-to-service connectivity and communication. With VPC Lattice, you can use policies to define network tratiic management,

AWS Verined Access

access, and monitoring to connect compute services in a simplified and secure way across instances, containers, and serverless applications.

## AWS App Mesh

AWS App Mesh makes It easy to monitor and control microservices running on AWS. App Mesn standardizes how your microservices communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and helping to ensure high-availability for your applications.

Modern applications are often composed of multiple microservices that each perform a specific function. This architecture helps to increase the availability and scalability of the application by allowing each component to scale independently based on demand, and automatically degrading functionality when a component fails instead of going offline. Each microservice interacts with all the other microservices through an API. As the number of microservices grows within an application, it becomes increasingly difficult to pinpoint the exact location of errors, re-route traffic after failures, and safely deploy code changes. Previously, this has required you to build monitoring and control logic directly into your code and redeploy your microservices every time there are changes.

AWS App Mesh makes it easy to run microservices by providing consistent visibility and network traffic controls for every microservice in an application. App Mesh removes the need to update application code to change how monitoring data is collected or traffic is routed between microservices. App Mesh configures each microservice to export monitoring data and implements consistent communications control logic across your application. This makes it easy to quickly pinpoint the exact location of errors and automatically re-route network traffic when there are failures or when code changes need to be deployed.

You can use App Mesh with Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS to better run containerized microservices at scale. App Mesh uses the open source Envoy proxy, making it compatible with a wide range of AWS partner and open source tools for monitoring microservices.

## AWS Ctoud Map

AWS Cloud Map is a cloud resource discovery service. With AWS Cloud Map, you can define custom names for your application resources, and it maintains the updated location of these dynamically changing resources. This increases your application availability because your web service always discovers the most up-to-date locations of its resources.

Modern applications are typically composed of multiple services that are accessible over an API and perform a specific function. Each service interacts with a variety of other resources such as

AWS App Mesh 116

databases, queues, object stores, and customer-defined microservices, and they also need to be able to find the location of all the infrastructure resources on which it depends, in order to function. You typically manually manage all these resource names and their locations within the application code. However, manual resource management becomes time consuming and error-prone as the number of dependent infrastructure resources increases or the number of microservices dynamically scale up and down based on traffic. You can also use third-party service discovery products, but this requires installing and managing additional software and infrastructure.

AWS Cloud Map allows you to register any application resources such as databases, queues, microservices, and other cloud resources with custom names. AWS Cloud Map then constantly checks the health of resources to make sure the location is up-to-date. The application can then query the registry for the location of the resources needed based on the application version and deployment environment.

## AWS Direct Connect

AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your data center, office, or co-location environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internetbased connections.

AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations. Using industry standard 802.1Q virtual LANs (VLANs), this dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces. This allows you to use the same connection to access public resources, such as objects stored in Amazon $3 using public IP address space, and private resources such as EC2 instances running within a VPC using private IP address space, while maintaining network separation between the public and private environments. Virtual interfaces can be reconfigured at any time to meet your changing needs.

AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service that improves the availability and performance of the applications that you offer to your global users.

Today, if you deliver applications to your global users over the public internet, your users might face inconsistent availability and performance as they traverse through multiple public networks to reach your application. These public networks are often congested and each hop can introduce

AWS Direct Connect

availability and performance risk. AWS Global Accelerator uses the highly available and congestionfree AWS global network to direct internet traffic from your users to your applications on AWS, making your users' experience more consistent.

To improve the availability of your application, you must monitor the health of your application endpoints and route traffic only to healthy endpoints. AWS Global Accelerator improves application availability by continuously monitoring the health of your application endpoints and routing traffic to the closest healthy endpoints.

AWS Global Accelerator also makes it easier to manage your global applications by providing static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application hosted on AWS which eliminates the complexity of managing specific IP addresses for different AWS Regions and Availability Zones. AWS Global Accelerator is easy to set up, configure and manage.

## AWS PrivateLink

AWS PrivateLink simplifies the security of data shared with cloud-based applications by eliminating the exposure of data to the public Internet. AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises applications, securely on the Amazon network. AWS PrivateLink makes it easy to connect services across different accounts and VPCs to significantly simplify the network architecture.

## AWS Private 5G

AWS Private 5G offers an easy way to use cellular technology to augment your current network. This can help you increase reliability, extend coverage, or allow a new class of workloads, such as factory automation, autonomous robotics, and advanced augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR). You will receive all the Private 5G hardware (including SIM cards) and software you need to deploy your private cellular network and connect devices to your applications.

With a Tew clicks in the AWS Management Console, deploy a private cellular network that meets your connectivity requirements. Start by specifying the connectivity requirements Tor the desired Location, the number of devices you want to connect, and the geographic area they will cover. AWS will deliver pre-integrated hardware and software components (from both AWS and our AWS Partners) that meet the enterprise connectivity requirements of your private network. AWS delivers and maintains the small cell radio units, servers, 5G core, radio access network (RAN) software, and SIM cards required to set up a private 5G network and connect devices. Once the equipment Is powered on, AWS automatically configures and deploys the cellular network. All you need to do is insert the SIM cards into your devices.

AWS PrivateLink

AWS Private 5G Is also integrated with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), which helps you securely access and manage AWS services and resources, including all devices connected to your Private 5G network. Private 5G manages and maintains all the software and hardware components to deliver reliable, predictable network behavior and on-demand scaling to accommodate any number of devices and sensors.

## AWS Transit Gateway

AWS Transit Gateway is a service that enables customers to connect their Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and their on-premises networks to a single gateway. As you grow the number of workloads running on AWS, you need to be able to scale your networks across multiple accounts and Amazon VPCs to keep up with the growth. Today, you can connect pairs of Amazon VPCs using peering. However, managing point-to-point connectivity across many Amazon VPCs, without the ability to centrally manage the connectivity policies, can be operationally costly and cumbersome. For on-premises connectivity, you need to attach your AWS VPN to each individual Amazon VPC. This solution can be time consuming to build and hard to manage when the number of VPCs grows into the hunareas.

With AWS Transit Gateway, you only have to create and manage a single connection from the central gateway in to each Amazon VPC, on-premises data center, or remote office across your network. Transit Gateway acts as a hub that controls how traffic is routed among all the connected networks which act like spokes. This hub and spoke model significantly simplifies management and reduces operational costs because each network only has to connect to the Transit Gateway and not to every other network. Any new VPC is simply connected to the Transit Gateway and Is then automatically available to every other network that is connected to the Transit Gateway. This ease of connectivity makes it easy to scale your network as you grow.

AWS Virtual Private Network (AWS VPN) solutions establish secure connections between your on-premises networks, remote offices, client devices, and the AWS global network. AWS VPN Is comprised of two services: AWS Site-to-Site VPN and AWS Client VPN. Each service provides a highly-available, managed, and elastic cloud VPN solution to protect your network traffic.

AWS Site-to-Site VPN creates encrypted tunnels between your network and your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds or AWS Transit Gateways. For managing remote access, AWS Client VPN connects your users to AWS or on-premises resources using a VPN software client.

## Elastic Load Balancing

Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and IP adaresses. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones. Elastic Load Balancing offers four types of load balancers that all feature the high availability, automatic scaling, and robust security necessary to make your applications fault tolerant.

- e Application Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic and provides advanced request routing targeted at the delivery of modern application architectures, including microservices and containers. Operating at the individual request level (Layer seven), Application Load Balancer routes traffic to targets within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) based on the content of the request.
- e Network Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of TCP trathic where extreme performance is required. Operating at the connection level (Layer four), Network Load Balancer routes traffic to targets within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) and is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies. Network Load Balancer is also optimized to handle sudden and volatile traffic patterns.
- e Gateway Load Balancer makes it easy to deploy, scale, and run third-party virtual networking appliances. Providing load balancing and auto scaling for fleets of third-party appliances, Gateway Load Balancer is transparent to the source and destination of traffic. This capability makes it well suited Tor working with third-party appliances for security, network analytics, and otner use cases.
- e Classic Load Balancer provides basic load balancing across multiple Amazon EC2 instances and operates at both the request level and connection level. Classic Load Balancer is intended Tor applications that were built within the EC2-Classic network. EC2-Classic was retired on August 15, 2022.

AWS RoboMaker provides a robotics development environment for application development, a robotics simulation service to accelerate application testing, and a robotics fleet management service tor remote application deployment, update, and management.

Robots are machines that sense, compute, and take action. Robots need instructions to accomplish tasks, and these instructions come in the form of applications that developers code to determine how the robot will behave. Receiving and processing sensor data, controlling actuators for movement, and performing a specific task are all Tunctions that are typically automated by these intelligent robotics applications. Intelligent robots are being increasingly used in warehouses to distribute inventory, in homes to carry out tedious housework, and in retail stores to provide customer service. Robotics applications use machine learning in order to perform more complex tasks like recognizing an object or face, having a conversation with a person, Tollowing a spoken commana, or navigating autonomously.

Until now, developing, testing, and deploying intelligent robotics applications was difficult ana time consuming. Building intelligent robotics functionality using machine learning is complex and requires specialized skills. Setting up a development environment can take each developer days and building a realistic simulation system to test an application can take months due to the underlying infrastructure needed. Once an application has been developed and tested, a developer needs to build a deployment system to deploy the application into the robot and later update the application while the robot is in use.

AWS RoboMaker provides you with the tools to make building intelligent robotics applications more accessible, a fully managed simulation service for quick and easy testing, anda deployment service for lifecycle management. AWS RoboMaker removes the heavy lifting

## AWS Grouna Station

AWS Ground Station ts a fully managed service that lets you control satellite communications, downlink and process satellite data, and scale your satellite operations quickly, easily and cost-effectively without having to worry about building or managing your own ground station infrastructure. Satellites are used for a wide variety of use cases, including weather forecasting, Surface imaging, communications, and video broadcasts. Ground stations are at the core of global satellite networks, which are facilities that provide communications between the ground and the satellites by using antennas to receive data and control systems to send radio signals to command and control the satellite. Today, you must either build your own ground stations and antennas, or obtain long-term leases with ground station providers, often in multiple countries to provide enough opportunities to contact the satellites as they orbit the globe. Once all this data is downloaded, you need servers, storage, and networking in close proximity to the antennas to process, store, and transport the data from the satellites.

AWS Ground Station eliminates these problems by delivering a global ground station as a service. We provide direct access to AWS services and the AWS Global Infrastructure including our low-latency global fiber network right where your data is downloaded into our AWS Ground Station. This enables you to easily control satellite communications, quickly ingest and process your satellite data, and rapidly integrate that data with your applications and other services running in the AWS Cloud. For example, you can use Amazon S34 to store the downloaded data, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for managing data ingestion from satellites, SageMaker Al Tor pbuilding custom machine learning applications that apply to your data sets, and Amazon EC2 to command and download data trom satellites. AWS Ground Station can help you save up to 80% on the cost of your ground station operations by allowing you to pay only for the actual antenna time used, and relying on our global footprint of ground stations to download data when and wnere you need it, instead of building and operating your own global ground station infrastructure. There are no long-term commitments, and you gain the ability to rapidly scale your satellite communications on-demand when your business needs it.

Amazon Detective further simplifies account management for security operations and investigations across all existing and future accounts In an organization using AWS Organizations for up to 1,200 AWS accounts.

AWS security services such as Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Macie, and AWS Security Hub, as well as partner security products, can be used to identify potential security issues, or findings. These services are really helpful in alerting you when and where there is possible unauthorized access or suspicious benavior in your AWS deployment. However, sometimes there are security findings that you would like to perform deeper investigations of the events that led to the findings to remediate the root cause. Determining the root cause of security findings can be a complex process for security analysts that often involves collecting and combining logs from many data sources, using extract, transform, and load (ETL) tools, and custom scripting to organize the data.

Amazon Detective simplifies this process by enabling your security teams to easily investigate and quickly get to the root cause of a finding. Detective can analyze trillions of events from multiple data sources such as Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon GuardDuty. Detective uses these events to automatically create a unified, interactive view of your resources, users, and the interactions between them over time. With this unified view, you can visualize all the details and context in one place to identify the underlying reasons for the findings, dritl down into relevant historical activities, and quickly determine the root cause.

You can get started with Amazon Detective in just a few clicks in the AWS Management Console. There is no software to deploy, or data sources to enable and maintain. You can try Detective at no additional charge with a 30-day Tree trial that is available to new accounts.

This means customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, lol devices, and big data analytics. Amazon S4 provides easy-to-use management features so you can organize your data and configure finely-tuned access controls to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements. Amazon S34 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9s) of durability, and stores data for millions of applications for companies all around the world.

Amazon S3 storage classes are a range of storage classes that you can choose from based on the data access, resiliency, and cost requirements of your workloads. S43 storage classes are purposebuilt to provide the lowest cost storage for different access patterns. S3 storage classes are ideal for virtually any use case, including those with demanding performance needs, data residency requirements, unknown or changing access patterns, or archival storage.

The S43 storage classes include:

- e S3 Intelligent-Tiering for automatic cost savings for data with unknown or changing access patterns
- e S3 Standard for frequently accessed data
- - S3 Express One Zone for your most frequently accessed data
- e S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) and S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) for less frequently accessed data
- e Â§3 Glacier Instant Retrieval for archive data that needs immediate access
- e S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly S35 Glacier) for rarely accessed long-term data that does not require immediate access
- e Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive (S3 Glacier Deep Archive) for long-term archive and digital preservation with retrieval in hours at the lowest cost storage in the cloud

If you nave data residency requirements that can't be met by an existing AWS Region, you can use the $3 Outposts storage class to store your S43 data on premises. Amazon S34 also offers capabilities to manage your data throughout its lifecycle. Once an S34 Lifecycle policy is set, your data will automatically transfer to a different storage class without any changes to your application. For more information, refer to the Amazon S4 storage classes overview into grapnic.

You can use S3 Object Lock to help prevent $3 objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time, or indefinitely. Object Lock can help you to meet regulatory requirements that require WORM (write-once-read-many) storage, or to simply add another layer of protection against object changes or deletion.
